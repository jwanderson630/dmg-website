<h4> The lead lifecycle Imperative:</h4>
<p>The <strong>lead lifecycle model</strong> is an approach that fits the reality of B2B marketing in this digital age. It’s a comprehensive approach for marketing teams required to measure and improve their contributions to sales success.</p>
<p>The traditional model of marketing program silos has widened the chasm between marketing and sales teams, and between companies and the prospects and customers they hope to attract. The leads generated through these programs are rarely optimized for sales engagement, and marketing teams often move on to the next program before the leads are cultivated, nurtured and converted to sales engagements.</p>
<p>This trend is attracting comment from industry experts and analysts. Forrester Group believes <em>“the sales funnel’s value as a framework is over, and a new model—the customer life cycle—provides a better fit with modern marketing as it puts the customer at the center of the effort, involves the entire brand experience, and describes an ongoing relationship.”</em></p>
<h4>The lead lifecycle: Managing and Measuring the sales readiness of leads</h4>
<p>The traditional marketing program management model comes with several drawbacks. Because campaigns and lead generation tactics typically have distinct beginnings and end points, marketing organizations can get caught in an ongoing cycle of repetitive and redundant activities that have limited longevity and impact.</p>
<p>An email campaign offering a white paper, for example, produces a series of downloads.</p>
<p>Contacts who downloaded the white paper are often categorized as “warm” leads and tossed over the proverbial fence to the sales team, and those who didn’t respond are discarded. The results are predictable. The marketing team moves on to the next program, the sales team scoffs at the quality of the leads provided and the email campaign invariably has little direct impact on sales success</p>
<p>Going from point A to point B and then starting over is also the Achilles heel of the traditional sales funnel. This linear, unidirectional model does not consider or leave flexibility for the true nature of buyers’ dynamic behaviors, desires and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Instead of a model centered around programs—each with distinct goals, leads, management processes, supporting tools, evaluation criteria, etc.—marketing teams now have an opportunity to pursue a new model.</p>
<p>It requires a fundamental shift in what is managed and measured, and it starts with a renewed focus on prospects and customers.</p>
<p>The new marketing model is centered on lead lifecycle management rather than program management. This model considers the dynamic and ongoing status of prospects and customers. It tracks their behavior and continually measures their “sales readiness” across all programs and touch points, restoring marketing teams’ insight and influence over the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Lead lifecycle management requires subtle but important shifts. Instead of generating and dispersing leads on a campaign basis, leads are generated, tracked, nurtured and scored on a continual basis, spanning all programs and activities. And, instead of measuring success against program execution, success is measured by lead conversions— in relation to sales readiness—and how those conversions are impacting revenue goals.</p>
