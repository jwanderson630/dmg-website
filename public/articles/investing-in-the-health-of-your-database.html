<p>Here are some chilling facts on the health of most marketing  databases: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Most B2B companies have just 5% to 25% of their target audience identified in their database. </li>
	<li>Data decays at a rate of 1% to 3% a month, making a significant proportion obsolete within a year. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>This webinar explores the health of your database addressing these key indicators:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>What is the profile of your ideal customer, and how well do the organizations and contacts within your database align with this profile?</li>
	<li>Does your database include all key decision makers in each organization? Can you be sure they cover all the levels/functions that are involved—directly or as influencers—in the buying process?</li>
	<li>What is your level of market coverage—have you identified 100% of the organizations in your target audience universe? </li>
	<li>How clean, consistent, complete and accurate is the information? Do you have verified opt-in email addresses for every contact? </li>
	<li>Have you set up a five-year plan to use as a database roadmap?</li>
	<li>How will you maintain your database accuracy and completeness?</li>
</ul>
