<ul>
	<li>85% of B2B marketers using marketing automation platforms feel that they’re not using them to their full potential.  <strong>How does your company rate?</strong> Are more than 50% of current email campaigns in an average month automatically “triggered” (automated) vs. “batch”?</li>
	<li>Do you currently segment email tracks based on sales stage (e.g. early, mid, late)?</li>
	<li>Do you currently employ a “lead recycling” campaign for leads that are rejected by sales? </li>
	<li>Do all new inbound leads receive one or more follow-up emails (auto-responders) independent of sales activity?</li>
	<li>Do you currently employ a lead score “threshold” that either alerts sales or sends a lead to sales</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered ‘No’ to one or more of these questions, there’s a strong chance your marketing automation platform has potential for optimization.</p>
