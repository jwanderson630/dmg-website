<p>“Engage or become irrelevant”, Steve Lucas, CEO, Marketo</p>
<p>We’re living in a new era – one where the buyer is in control and ready to research and form an opinion about your brand and product without you even being aware of their interest.  Rather than market to the buyer, companies need to engage with the buyer and deliver an experience that’s relevant and personal to what the buyer cares about. </p>
<p>Learn how to prepare for and build a sustained engagement strategy that can double response and increase lead conversions.</p>
